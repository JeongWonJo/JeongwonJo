                  <h3>🧐 Why Coproduction?</h3>
                  <p>Our data showed that locals played an active role in producing and reciprocally exchanging support, regardless of when they joined, reflecting coproduction</p>
                  <p>Unilateral disaster relief delivery was sufficient in previous disasters, where no or less affected citizens (providers) offered support to those affected (recipients). However, because <strong>everyone was affected by the immediate biological or broader social consequences of COVID-19</strong>, <strong>unilateral support was insufficient</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Expected benefits of coproduction include more <strong>responsive participants, reduced costs, and the increase in the quality, quantity, and diversity of service</strong></p>
                  <p>A deeper understanding of how citizens coproduced disaster relief can lay the groundwork for more <strong>extensive, sustained, and diverse relief</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Selecting interview targets:</strong> innovative disaster relief cases, those with emergent structural arrangements in operation, resources utilized, or tasks and activities engaged in.</p>
                  <p><strong>Semi-structured interviews:</strong> 10 semi-structured interview sessions with 14 organizers and 3 sessions with 3 volunteers. </p>
                  <p>‍<strong>Predefined questions for organizers:<br>• </strong>How was your disaster relief group initiated?<br>• How did your group support community members?

                  <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Those in need without digital devices or the Internet were not aware of support initiatives; hard for civic initiatives to identify people who needed support</p>
                  <blockquote>&quot;A lot of people who were looking for this kind of service don’t necessarily have a smartphone or Internet access...and won’t be familiar with[our initiative]&quot; (P3)<br><br>&quot;a challenge [was] in trying to figure out where [we were] needed the most&quot; (P12)</blockquote>

                  <blockquote>&quot;We find it easier to work through institutions rather than ending it up to individual...we are working through the schools, ..., Parents for Homeschooling, ..., and the [city recreation]center, so we don’t have to make judgments about who deserves one, who doesn’t.&quot; (P5)</blockquote>

                  <h3>4. Broader Impacts of Coproduced Disaster Relief</h3>
                  <p>Civic initiatives were aimed at specific disaster relief outcomes (e.g., attenuating food insecurity, addressing PPE shortages). In addition to achieving their missions, they also had broader positive impacts on individual volunteers and the wider community.</p>
                  <h5><strong>Individual Level:</strong> Promoting Psychological Well-being of Individuals</h5>
                  <p>Before Joining Initiatives: Many got laid off and social activities that reminded them that they mattered suddenly disappeared; felt depressive</p>
                  <blockquote>felt “anxious and helpless” (P13)<br>“[I felt] so bad and [wanted] to do something” (P16)<br>felt bad when “frontline workers [were] working hard” (P14)<br></blockquote>
                  <p>After Joining Initiatives: Volunteers <strong>felt rewarding</strong> and felt good for making contributions to the community</p>
                  <blockquote>“it was nice to see that...I can do something to help” (P8)<br>‍<br>“Providing the funds [gave] a sense of helping the healthcare workers in a way that [we] would not have been able to do so before.” (P15)<br>‍<br>“Extra things we did...seem to be appreciated by the community...we feel good about what we’ve done...to help the community out” (P17)</blockquote>
                  <p>After Joining Initiatives: Organizers and volunteers received <strong>appreciation</strong> from the people they helped, which started <strong>a cycle of prosocial behaviors </strong>and had a longer-lasting impact throughout the community.<br></p>
                  <blockquote>A local grocery store purchased meals from P17&#x27;s restaurant to thank their staff for doing essential work during the pandemic. P17 joined the act of appreciation by writing a thank-you card with an uplifting message for grocery store workers, and they visited her restaurant and appreciated her back: “Being part of a greater cause has come back ten fold...We showed our appreciation, and then they showed their appreciation to us...small acts of appreciation...can go a long way” (P17)</blockquote>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h5>Community Level: A Starting Point to Serving Local Community and Beyond</h5>
                  <p>Before COVID-19, although people knew that vulnerable members had always existed, they did not take the issue seriously enough to take action. COVID-19 made people <strong>recognize and start providing support for vulnerable community members</strong> who had been easily unnoticed and been left out of society. </p>
                  <blockquote>The original intention of P13&#x27;s initiative was to feed healthcare workers and revive local businesses, but they expanded their attention “more and more to supporting people with severe food insecurity or house insecurity” (P13)<br>‍<br>“There always, unfortunately, will be people in need, there are always people who want to help. So we are aiming to continue this effort far beyond COVID-19.” (P3)</blockquote>
                  <p>Civic initiatives also helped local communities <strong>realize and appreciate community service workers</strong> who were often under-recognized, such as those at testing centers, postal workers, and social workers.</p>
                  <blockquote>P17 hoped that even after the pandemic, “just regular everyday, people remember about...anybody that is in a social service role [who] does thousands of work for the community”<br>‍<br>“They should continue with it even after COVID-19... lots of people do lots of things in our community that make it worth living...we can appreciate other groups of people doing so much to our community.” (P16)</blockquote>

                <h2>Future Research Insights</h2>
                <h3>Coproduction of Civic Disaster Relief in Other Countries</h3>
                <p>This paper is a starting point for applying a lens of coproduction to interpret citizen-based disaster relief efforts and to see that coproductive disaster relief does happen. Non-U.S.-based local communities may have different types or levels of civic disaster relief. Future work could explore how other civic initiatives in other cultures coproduced relief efforts and their impacts to see if new themes arise. </p>
